Select By Regex 2.0.0
===

[Discontinued plugin](https://github.com/tarwich/SelectByRegex) was replaced with [new one](https://github.com/mvoidex/SublimeSelectRegex), so I recommend to read README.md.
Here's some significant changes:
 * There are three different commands:
     - `Select By Regex: All` to select all, which behaviour is closest to old command, but it doesn't restrict search for line, so you have to expand selection to line (`Ctrl+L`) if neccessary
     - `Select By Regex: Next` to select next regex after each current selection
     - `Select By Regex: Next (multiline)` to select next regex on the same line after each current selection
 * You can use special group `(!...)` in regex to specify what to actually select
 * You can use `$_` to match string under current selection
 * There is no `history` command; if you need it, please make an issue
